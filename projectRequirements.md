Create & Read Boards
As a user, I want to be able to...

Create
Create a new board, by filling out a form. The form includes "title" and "owner" name of the board.
See an error message if I try to make a new board with an empty/blank/invalid/missing "title" or "owner" input.
All error messages can look like a new section on the screen, a red outline around the input field, and/or disabling the input, as long as it's visible
Hide the "New Board" form, so I don't have to see the "New Board" form all the time when I'm looking at cards.
